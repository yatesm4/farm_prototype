# Farming Prototype

No thats not really the name of the game; putting the actual name would give away the secrecy and allure of the project.
Plus the actual game this prototype is for is themed around NSFW ideas and I want to be able to show this to coworkers at work.

## Getting Started

Hopefully this readme will direct anyone to the proper information / resource, and/or answer any questions one might have.

### Prereqs

```
Visual Studio 2017 is probably the preferred IDE
```

```
MonoGame
```

Plants to Grow Space - multiple spaces? i.e 2 garages 3 barns

Recruit helpers / workers?

Storefront to sell?
		Until you unlock the storefront(mid to late game) / license, you have to sell on the street
			But the store can still be affected by the police
			If you dont renew the license, theres an RNG chance to get raided
			And lose everything in the store (but not everything growing in a separate location)

Different weed types indica/ sativa 

Create Hash, Oil, Hemp Products
(2 plans for 1 hash or what ever)

Stronger strains = more money / more risk

Easy Normal Hard mode = no cops / cops / lots of cops	
	But weed price scales with the difficulty

GROW MECHANICS
1 soil, 1 light, 1 water, 1 seed - each costs $$

lvl 1 weed needs only 1 of each
	different strands need different combos?

lvl 2 weed will need more?

soil light and water levels?

1 min to grow - uses up the soil light water and seed points/curency
	grow time will take a MAX of 10 mins at late game?

Tap on the plot (or activate) to bring up the plant menu
	choose the seed - will show how much of the "points" of each you need
	from here it will start to grow the plant

Once the weed has grown you can then trim it (do we want to have RNG where the plan can be male?)
	Triming will then give you the weed (and hemp ??) to sell OR make into hash / oil / butter
	
SELL MECHANICS

Unless you have a license or a shop you will have to sell to a dealer or on the street
	(license can be aquired after so many sales?)

You can get busted and lose your current money and weed - even at late game when you own a shop
	(you can never lose seeds)

selling brings you in $$$ - used to buy more Light Water Soil and Seeds
	save enough to purchase bigger grow spaces
