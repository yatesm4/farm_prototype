# Farming Prototype

No thats not really the name of the game; putting the actual name would give away the secrecy and allure of the project.
Plus the actual game this prototype is for is themed around NSFW ideas and I want to be able to show this to coworkers at work.

## Getting Started

Hopefully this readme will direct anyone to the proper information / resource, and/or answer any questions one might have.

### Prereqs
