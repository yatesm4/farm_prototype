# MonoGame Prototyping Sandbox

This isn't a game. It was going to be, but became a project where ideas were prototyped instead. The change to be a prototyping sandbox rather than an actual project gave me room where I could develop and try new ideas- ideas that would, probably, be later implemented into future projects.

There were a few ideas implemented in this project that never saw light in my other work, and that is why this project remains kept- so I can hopefully try to utilize those half-baked ideas. 

## Getting Started

Hopefully this readme will direct anyone to the proper information / resource, and/or answer any questions one might have.
